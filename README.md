## Logo

Our logo was created starting with this beautiful design https://thenounproject.com/icon/loch-ness-monster-337673/ that was created by https://thenounproject.com/mat.rutherford/ (his pesonal website: http://matrutherford.com/) and downloaded from The Noun Project website (https://thenounproject.com/). Many thanks to both the creator of the illustration and The Noun Project. The final logo was then elaborated using Figma.
